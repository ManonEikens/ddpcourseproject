## Create a shiny-app

For the course project you have to make a shiny app

You can show what you've learned in the course

It can be everything you want it to be!

--- .class #id 

## Requirements

1. Some form of input (widget)
2. Some operation on the ui input in server.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. Include enough documentation
5. Documentation should be at the Shiny website itself

--- .class #id 

## My app

For my app I decided to provide a calculator to calculate the optimal calorie intake per day

To do that I take into account the following parameters:

1. Gender
2. Age
3. Height
4. Weight

--- .class #id 

## Example of the formula

Here is an example for a male:

- 40 years
- height 180 centimeters
- weight 70 kilograms

```{r}
age <- 40
height <- 180
weight <- 70
calorieintake <- 10 * weight + 6.25 * height - 5 * age + 5
calorieintake
```
